First - dont need the hint under main playlist "long-press/right-click..."
Seconds - Subplaylist should state in one line, use "..." for the missing part if title too long.
Thirds - if the list of tracks too long.. support srolling.. but the buttons at the bottom should not override or move (clear playlist button, export button, import buttion)
Four - The pop up diaglog need to redesign to fit in .. or support vertical buttons, should not missing elements.
